# Voice Outperforms Text in Identifying Personality Traits in Bangla: A Comparative Study

This repository contains the the research paper, **"Voice Outperforms Text in Identifying Personality Traits in Bangla: A Comparative Study"**, which was **accepted at the 27th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)**.

## Overview
Personality trait detection is an emerging area in psychological profiling, human-computer interaction, and personalized services. This study compares text-based and voice-based methods for identifying personality traits in Bangla, demonstrating the superiority of voice analysis over traditional text methods.

## Highlights
- **Voice-based models outperform text-based methods**, with VGG19 achieving an accuracy of **79.17%**, significantly higher than text-based approaches.
- Utilized **state-of-the-art deep learning architectures**:
  - **VGG19**: Best-performing model for voice-based personality detection.
  - **ResNet-50**: Also used for comparative evaluation.
- A novel dataset of Bangla speech recordings was compiled, covering diverse demographics and personality traits.




## Applications
- **Psychological profiling**
- **Human-computer interaction**
- **Personalized services**
